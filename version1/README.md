1. Open a Linux terminal inside the folder containing source codes and compile both source codes inside the terminal by entering the commands `gcc Client.c -o Client` and `gcc Server.c -o Server`.
>It can be compiled to program of any name of choosing by changing the word that comes after `-o`
2. Open another Linux terminal
3. In one of the terminals, run the Server program by entering `./Server` or whichever name you've given it
4. In the other terminal, run the Client program by entering `./Client` or whichever name you've given it
5. This should produce a message in the terminal indicating that bunch of signals have been sent, thus indicating that the program have been run successfully
