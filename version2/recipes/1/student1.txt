How to Make a Club Sandwich
Making a turkey club sandwich can be as easy or as elaborate as you want! With a few simple steps you can create a basic club sandwich, add a few extra layers or toppings and you can dress this sandwich up as much as you’d like!

First Layer: Spread the mayo on one side of lightly toasted bread. Add turkey, tomato and cheese (be sure to put the tomatoes in the middle so the bread doesn’t get soggy).
Second Layer: Layer ham, bacon and lettuce.
Top with the final slices of bread, secure with cute sandwich picks and cut into quarters
