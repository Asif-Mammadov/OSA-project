Toss until evenly coated. Spread in a single layer over the baking sheet and bake at 350˚F until light golden and crisp (10-12 minutes), or to desired crispness.

How to Make Caesar Salad Dressing:

Slowly drizzle in extra virgin olive oil while whisking constantly.

Whisk in 1/2 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp black pepper, or season to taste.
